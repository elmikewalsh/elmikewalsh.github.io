If you've made it this far, you can probably guess that my name is Mike (Michael) Walsh, and I am a real, live human being!</p><p>I was born and raised in Westmont, Illinois in the noth-centeral part of the United States, for the first 30 or so years of my life.  During my time at the University, I also had the opportunity to spend 3 months in the south-central part of Chile, in a city called San Pedro de la Paz (Which is next to Concepción, an even larger city).</p><p>This would prove to be a very important detail up until now in this story called life.</p><p>While I was in the University, I also became fascinated with the World Wide Web. In the really early years - we're talking 1997 - I remember going to the basement of the dormitory where I lived and searching for "How to create a website" on the internet. Since I was a poor university student without money or credit cards, the only hosting I could access was ...*gasp*... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities" alt="Wikipedia entry for GeoCities" title="Wikipedia entry for GeoCities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GeoCities</a> (I hang my head in shame).</p><p>Little by little, as the years passed by, I became more adept at designing, and coding. While everyone else was going out to the bars, I was taking my first steps in learning PHP...</p><p>I also discovered that, once I learn how to do something, I thoroughly enjoy explaining (or enjoy explaining thoroughly.....) how it works to other people. This is where the "pedagogical love" part of my education comes in, I suppose.  Well, once the university part of life was over, it took a few years to figure out what (or where) I wanted to do this "life" thing. So I took the crazy decision to move to Chile.</p><hr><h3>"Down Under" Sans Kangaroos</h3><p>The actual process of moving to Chile was looooong. It involved sleeping (somewhat) in the Atlanta airport, discovering there was a small problem with my air ticket which almost left me stranded, and - of course - the 14-hour flight with all my possesions.</p><p>But once I arrived in Chile, things got better quickly. I started working in an institue in the city of Chillán, which connected me to many wonderful people (including my wife). And 2 years later our child was born!  =)</p><p>A strange turn of events led me to start working with <a href="https://www.teachingchile.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TeachingChile</a>, the company that provided me a foothold in Chile. I began by working freelance on periodic website updates, while also working some freelance work on the side under the name <a href="https://www.imaginalgo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imaginalgo</a>. and joined the team at the start of 2012. This was my first taste of "remote work".  At the same time I wrapped up work at a language institute in Valdivia - to present it has been the last job I was required to "go to".</p><hr><h3>Career Shift</h3><p>I was soon sought out by another language institute which offered me the chance to teach classes via the internet - I continued with both of these remote jobs for the next several years.  In 2017 I began work with <a href="http://www.optuno.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optuno</a> as a Web Designer and later as a Project Manager, which I continue to enjoy to the present.</p></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">© elmikewalsh.com.
