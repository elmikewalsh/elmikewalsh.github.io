    <h3>The Basics</h3>

    <p>My name is Mike (Michael) Walsh, and I am a real, live human being! Going into a bit more detail, I am a husband, a father, a son and a brother. I am somewhat tall, measuring 1.82m - tall by some culture's standards, and normal by others.</p>

    <p>I try to separate what I am from what I do. They are <strong>not</strong> the same.</p>
    <p>I try not to separate what I like from what I do. They <strong>should</strong> be the same.</p>

    <h3>The Early Years</h3>

    <p>I was born in a hospital in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinsdale,_Illinois" alt="Wikipedia entry for Hinsdale, Illinois." title="Wikipedia entry for Hinsdale, Illinois." target="_blank">Hinsdale, Illinois</a>. (That's in the north-central part of the United States). I was a happy child; I rode my bike everywhere, I went to school, and then I went to the University. Eastern Illinois University, to be precise. During my many, many years there, I learned many things from books, many other things from life, and managed to walk away with a few papers that said I was "educated".</p>

    <p>Favorite toy: <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/" alt="Lego Website" title="Lego Website" target="_blank">Legos</a>. Without a doubt. I loved putting them together and taking them apart. As a ritual, I would first put together whatever particular Lego set using the step-by-step instructions provided. I would then look at the box the blocks came in; there were always about 3-4 more variations of things you could build with the same blocks. After that, I would create whatever crazy thing I could think of. They were a pain to put away. I often left my bedroom a disaster, thanks to Legos (sorry, mom!).</p>

    <p>Legos were a very important part of the process. Thanks, Legos!</p>


    <h3>The "Higher Education" Bit</h3>

    <p>During my time at the University, I also had the opportunity to spend 3 months in the south-central part of Chile, in a city called San Pedro de la Paz (Which is next to Concepción, an even larger city).</p>

    <p>This would prove to be a very important detail in this story called life.</p>

    <p>While I was in the University, I became fascinated with the World Wide Web. In the really early years - we're talking 1997 - I remember going to the basement of the dormitory where I lived and searching for "How to create a website" on the internet. Since I was a poor university student without money or credit cards, the only hosting I could access was ...*gasp*... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities" alt="Wikipedia entry for GeoCities" title="Wikipedia entry for GeoCities" target="_blank">GeoCities</a>  (I hang my head in shame).</p>

    <p>Little by little, as the years passed by, I became more adept at designing, and coding. While everyone else was going out to the bars, I was taking my first steps in learning PHP...</p>

    <p>I also discovered that, once I learn how to do something, I thoroughly enjoy explaining how it works to other people. This is where the "pedagogical love" part of my education comes in, I suppose (K-12 Illinois Teacher Certificate: Spanish).</p>

    <p>Anyways, those "papers" that the University gave me said that I knew a thing or two about History and Latin America (B.A. History, Minor in Latin American Studies), as well as languages. Especially Spanish (B.A. Foreign Languages - Spanish).</p>

    <p>After a bit of searching for what to do with my life, I took the drastic decision to move to Chile.</p>


    <h3>The Great Move</h3>

    <p>The actual process of moving to Chile was looooong. It involved sleeping (somewhat) in the Atlanta airport, discovering there was a small problem with my air ticket which almost left me stranded, and - of course - the 14-hour flight with all my possesions.</p>

    <p>But once I arrived in Chile, things got better quickly. I started working in an institue in the city of Chillán, which connected me to many wonderful people (including my wife) but was otherwise unremarkable.</p>

    <p>I have since lived in and traveled to many cities in Chile. When I get the chance, I will write about it. For now, I live in south-central Chile, near Villarrica, and I pass the time with family, designing and teaching stuff to people.</p>
